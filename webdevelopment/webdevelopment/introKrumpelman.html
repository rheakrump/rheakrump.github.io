    Hi! I am Rhea Krumpelman. I’m from Marceline, MO, a small town north of Columbia. I am an English major in my second year of study. I don’t have any previous web development experience yet, which is the primary reason that I am taking this class. In this course, I hope to learn the foundations of website development. The basics of HTML and CSS will be a useful addition to my skill set. With this knowledge, I would like to create my own website or blog to share some of my academic writings and thoughts. When I'm not doing schoolwork, I love spending time with my family and friends. Some of my hobbies include thrift-flipping clothes, sewing, and watercolor painting. I also enjoy hiking and anything outdoorsy.
