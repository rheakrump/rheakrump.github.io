        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <main>
        <p>

            I’m from Marceline, a small town in north central Missouri.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am a second-year English major studying at
            the University of Missouri, Columbia. 
            My emphasis area is Creative Writing. 
            I intend to enter the career field of writing and editing upon 
            graduation in May 2026. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have had the opportunity to explore my interest in writing 
            through personal and academic endeavors. One of my most recent personal 
            projects is the beginnings of a novel. I am also working on a blog to 
            share specific academic writings and thoughts. Some of my hobbies include
            thrift-flipping clothes, sewing, and watercolor painting. I also enjoy 
            hiking and anything outdoorsy.

            <br>An “about me” wouldn’t be complete without mentioning my family and friends. 
            I try to make my relationships with the people in my life my first priority.
