    <h2>Artistic Statement</h2>
    <h3>
        Art is meant to raise the soul higher, not lose it in confused self-seeking. 
    </h3>

    <div class="stmt">
    <p class="p1">
        As an amateur writer, the question of why arises quite often.
        Why do you write? Why create stories or essays or poetry? 
        Writing is not a hard science, so its value can often be overlooked. 
        So, this is my reasoning; this is why the arts matter. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        “The way to truth is goodness. The way to goodness is beauty.” 
        Therefore, create what is beautiful. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beauty is multifaceted. What is beautiful is not restricted to something 
        that elicits a certain emotion, such as happiness. 
        When one hears a symphony, or sees a painted masterpiece, or reads a great 
        work of literature, the heart responds in more than emotion.
        There is a longing that the art leaves within the heart that can’t quite be satisfied.
        It is a mixture of hope, wonder, pain, and joy. The best way I’ve seen this described is in the Gospel of Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Luke 24: 13-33, the risen Christ meets two of his disciples on the road, and they do not recognize Him in His risen form. 
        He walks and talks with them, and eventually breaks bread with them. 
        Then, they recognize Him as Jesus and He “vanishes from their sight.”
        Then, they said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” 
    </p>
    <p>
        This burn within the human heart when encountering truth, beauty, and goodness is akin to a longing.
        A longing for what we were created for: Heaven. Beauty on this earth is a foretaste of Heaven.
        Pope St. John Paul II explained art’s role in this story when he said, “Humanity in every age, and even today, looks to works of art to shed light upon its path and its destiny.” 
        Therefore, art should be an instrument of beauty, and thereby an instrument through which the viewer or reader can experience the love of God.
