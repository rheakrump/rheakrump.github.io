            welcome to my writing portfolio!
        </h2>

        <p>
            I have always been captivated by 
            good writing and an author’s ability 
            to bring stories and ideas to life on the page, 
            hence my decision to become an English major. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, you will find a selection of my writing. 
            The works range from thought provoking essays to poetry 
            written for a college course. I believe that range is one 
            of the greatest skills a writer can possess. 
            To learn versatility, it is beneficial to be well-rounded 
            so that one’s interests encompass a variety of topics. 
            On the “About Me” page, I show how having broad interests
            has impacted my writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to browse my works, leave comments, 
            and reach out if something sparks your interest!
